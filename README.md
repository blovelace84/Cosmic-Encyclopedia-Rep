# Cosmic-Encyclopedia-Rep
 
For this exercise, I created this Cosmic Encyclopedia as part of my study in React.js through Springboard. This app was developed using Vite, React.js, and React Router. This website has a navbar to navigate through the website and has information about planets like Earth, Stars like the Sun, and Galaxies like the Anemeda Galaxy. The website button is where you can go back to the previous page you visited until reaching the home page. I had fun working on this app and can't wait to share.
